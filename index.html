   <p> My family and I love to go to this great park called Quail Ridge. It has something for everyone:</P> 
    <ol>
        <li>Playgrounds</li>
        <li>Dog park</li>
        <li>Trails for hiking</li>
        <li>Paved path</li>
        <li>Pavilions</li>
    </ol>
     </p> Quail ridge is great for any occassion, like birthday parties, or just a simple stroll on a winter afternoon or summer evening, whether the weather is  &gt 100 degrees or &lt 20. </P> 
   <main>The best part about Quail Ridge is how peaceful it is. It is an oasis in the middle of a suburban area. My family and I like to go for a long hike when the weather is nice to enjoy the scenery and each other. When it is hot, it is nice to take a break by the creek and skip rocks. It was the place my seven year old son skipped his first rock. He enjoyed it so much that he collected a handful of rocks and stuffed them in his pockets to save. Quail Ridge is a place where memories can be made.</main>

  <p>If you are looking for a good time and are in the St. Louis area, try out Quail Ridge. You'll see deer from the trails and can follow their tracks through the woods. This park is a must for wildlife lovers.  <b>Just look out for snakes!</b></p>
