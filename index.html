   <main>Quail ridge is great for any occassion, like birthday parties, or just a simple stroll on a winter afternoon or summer evening, whether the weather is  &gt 100 degrees or &lt 20. The best part about Quail Ridge is how peaceful it is. It is an oasis in the middle of a suburban area. My family and I like to go for a long hike when the weather is nice to enjoy the scenery and each other. When it is hot, it is nice to take a break by the creek and skip rocks. It was the place my seven year old son skipped his first rock. He enjoyed it so much that he collected a handful of rocks and stuffed them in his pockets to save. Quail Ridge is a place where memories can be made.</main>
